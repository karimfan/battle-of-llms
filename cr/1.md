Creating a **Code Review Rubric** is an excellent way to set expectations and ensure high-quality, consistent reviews across your team. Below is a structured **Code Review Matrix** with key criteria, organized into categories, along with qualitative ratings to guide reviewers.

# **Code Review Rubric**
| Category             | Excellent (‚úÖ) | Good (üëç) | Needs Improvement (‚ö†Ô∏è) | Poor (‚ùå) |
|----------------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Correctness** | Code fully meets requirements, handles edge cases, and passes all tests | Code meets requirements but has minor gaps (e.g., missing edge case handling) | Some functionality is incorrect, or tests fail | Code is functionally incorrect or introduces major regressions |
| **Readability & Maintainability** | Code is well-structured, easy to read, and follows best practices | Code is readable but could be slightly refactored for clarity | Code is hard to understand or contains inconsistencies | Code is unreadable or follows no conventions |
| **Performance & Efficiency** | Code is optimized and performs well under expected loads | Code performs well but has minor inefficiencies | Code contains potential performance bottlenecks | Code is inefficient and introduces serious performance issues |
| **Security** | No security vulnerabilities; follows best security practices | No obvious security issues, but minor improvements could be made | Potential security vulnerabilities present | Code introduces major security risks |
| **Testing & Coverage** | Comprehensive tests cover all key functionality and edge cases | Adequate tests exist, but some minor gaps remain | Tests exist but have low coverage or miss key cases | No tests or inadequate testing strategy |
| **Code Structure & Design** | Code is modular, follows SOLID principles, and is reusable | Code is well-structured but could be further improved for maintainability | Code has design flaws, tight coupling, or is difficult to extend | Code is disorganized and unmaintainable |
| **Scalability & Future-proofing** | Code is designed with future growth in mind and avoids technical debt | Code is fine for now but might need refactoring for scale later | Code is not scalable and will require major refactoring soon | Code is completely unscalable and will require full rework |
| **Documentation & Comments** | Clear and concise documentation, meaningful comments where needed | Some documentation is provided but could be improved | Little documentation, unclear or excessive comments | No documentation, or comments are misleading |
| **Adherence to Team Conventions** | Code strictly follows style guides and best practices | Mostly adheres to conventions with minor deviations | Some violations of style guides, inconsistent practices | Does not follow any agreed-upon team conventions |

### **How to Use the Rubric**
- Each review should **assess the code against these categories** and provide **constructive feedback** where necessary.
- Aim for code to be **at least "Good (üëç)"** in all categories before merging.
- If the code falls into **"Needs Improvement (‚ö†Ô∏è)"** or **"Poor (‚ùå)"**, reviewers should provide **actionable feedback** to help the author improve it.

### **Guidance for Reviewers**
- **Be constructive** ‚Äì provide suggestions, not just problems.
- **Balance thoroughness with efficiency** ‚Äì focus on high-impact areas.
- **Avoid personal preference nitpicks** ‚Äì only suggest changes that improve the code meaningfully.
- **Encourage learning** ‚Äì explain the *why* behind requested changes.
