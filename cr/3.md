# Code Review Rubric

A good code review rubric should establish clear expectations and provide a structured framework for evaluating code. Here's what I'd include:

## Functionality
- Does the code correctly implement the requirements?
- Does it handle edge cases appropriately?
- Are there any logical errors or bugs?

## Architecture & Design
- Does the solution follow good design principles (SOLID, DRY, etc.)?
- Is the code modular and reusable where appropriate?
- Are responsibilities properly separated?
- Is the overall approach appropriate for the problem?

## Performance & Efficiency
- Are there any obvious performance concerns?
- Are operations executed with appropriate algorithmic complexity?
- Are there any unnecessary computations or memory allocations?

## Security
- Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- Is sensitive data properly protected?
- Is input properly validated and sanitized?

## Readability & Maintainability
- Is the code self-documenting with clear naming?
- Is complex logic adequately commented?
- Would a new team member understand the code easily?
- Is the code consistent with our style guides?

## Testing
- Are unit tests comprehensive and meaningful?
- Are edge cases covered in tests?
- Is there sufficient coverage of critical paths?
- Are tests clear and maintainable themselves?

## Documentation
- Are public APIs well-documented?
- Are non-obvious decisions explained?
- Is there appropriate inline documentation?

## Version Control Practices
- Are commits logical and atomic?
- Are commit messages clear and descriptive?
- Was the code rebased/merged properly?

## Code Review Process 
- Is feedback specific and actionable?
- Are comments constructive rather than critical?
- Are positive aspects of the code acknowledged?
- Is feedback categorized by severity (blocker vs. suggestion)?

This rubric should be used as a guide rather than a rigid checklist, with emphasis on different areas depending on the specific context of each review.
