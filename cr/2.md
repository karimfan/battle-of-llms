Creating a rubric or matrix for defining a "good code review" is an excellent way to establish clear expectations and ensure consistency across the team. Below is a suggested framework for such a rubric. It breaks down the key aspects of a code review into categories, each with specific criteria and examples of what "good" looks like.

### **Scoring System (Optional)**
To make the rubric more actionable, you can introduce a scoring system. For example:
- **1 (Needs Improvement)**: The criterion is not met or is poorly addressed.
- **2 (Adequate)**: The criterion is partially met but could be improved.
- **3 (Good)**: The criterion is fully met and aligns with best practices.
- **4 (Excellent)**: The criterion exceeds expectations and demonstrates exceptional quality.

### **How to Use the Rubric**
1. **For Reviewers**:
   - Use the rubric as a checklist to ensure all aspects of the code are evaluated.
   - Provide feedback that aligns with the criteria and examples in the rubric.

2. **For Authors**:
   - Use the rubric as a guide to self-review your code before submitting it for review.
   - Address any gaps or weaknesses identified in the rubric.

3. **For the Team**:
   - Use the rubric to align on expectations and improve the quality of code reviews over time.
   - Regularly revisit and refine the rubric based on team feedback and evolving best practices.

### **Example Review Using the Rubric**
**Code Review for Feature X**  
| **Category**         | **Score** | **Feedback**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Correctness**       | 3         | The code handles most edge cases, but there’s no validation for null inputs.|
| **Readability**       | 4         | The code is clean, well-named, and easy to follow. Great job!               |
| **Maintainability**   | 2         | Some logic is duplicated. Consider extracting it into a helper function.    |
| **Performance**       | 3         | The code is efficient, but the nested loop could be optimized.              |
| **Security**          | 4         | Inputs are validated, and no vulnerabilities were found.                    |
| **Testing**           | 3         | Tests cover most scenarios, but edge cases like empty lists are missing.    |
| **Documentation**     | 2         | The code lacks comments explaining the complex sorting logic.               |
| **Consistency**       | 4         | The code follows our style guide and is consistent with the codebase.       |
| **Collaboration**     | 4         | Feedback was clear, constructive, and respectful.                          |
