Here’s my **code review assessment** based on the rubric.

# **Code Review Ratings**
| Category | Rating | Comments |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Correctness** | ⚠️ Needs Improvement | The code mostly works but has some issues, such as incorrect handling of multi-digit numbers. Also, `prefix_calculate2` returns a `string` while `prefix_calculate` returns an `int`, leading to inconsistencies. |
| **Readability & Maintainability** | ❌ Poor | The code is difficult to read due to inconsistent naming, deeply nested logic, and lack of clear separation between concerns. Function names should be more descriptive, and helper functions should be extracted to reduce complexity. |
| **Performance & Efficiency** | ⚠️ Needs Improvement | The approach using a slice for `tokens` leads to frequent reallocation, and `isNumber` checks could be improved. The recursive function (`prefix_calculate`) is inefficient due to unnecessary multiple traversals of the string. |
| **Security** | ✅ Excellent | No obvious security risks since it doesn't deal with external input sources beyond a string, but edge cases like divide by zero aren't handled. |
| **Testing & Coverage** | ❌ Poor | No unit tests are present. The main function contains test cases as comments, but this isn't sufficient. Proper unit tests should be written using Go’s testing framework. |
| **Code Structure & Design** | ❌ Poor | The code has tight coupling between parsing and execution, making it hard to extend. The two implementations (`prefix_calculate` and `prefix_calculate2`) are inconsistent and not well-structured. |
| **Scalability & Future-proofing** | ⚠️ Needs Improvement | The implementation doesn’t handle multi-digit numbers or input validation well. It also doesn’t scale well for large expressions due to excessive memory allocations. |
| **Documentation & Comments** | ❌ Poor | There are **no comments** explaining the logic, making it hard to follow. The purpose of `prefix_calculate2` versus `prefix_calculate` isn’t clear. |
| **Adherence to Team Conventions** | ❌ Poor | Naming is inconsistent (`prefix_calculate2` is poorly named, and `perfix_string` is a typo). The use of `*index++` is incorrect in Go and won’t compile. The use of `panic("Invalid input")` is harsh and should be replaced with proper error handling. |

# **Final Score: 3/10**
**Main Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Refactor for readability** – Use better naming conventions and extract helper functions.
2. **Fix correctness issues** – Handle multi-digit numbers and divide-by-zero cases.
3. **Improve test coverage** – Write proper unit tests using Go's `testing` package.
4. **Improve efficiency** – Optimize token processing to reduce unnecessary iterations.
5. **Improve maintainability** – Reduce deep nesting and use a more structured approach.
